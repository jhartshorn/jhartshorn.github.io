title: "Making the Switch to Visual Studio Code"

After years of dabbling with Vim and more recently NeoVim, I've finally made the jump to Visual Studio Code. As someone who only codes occasionally these days, I found myself spending more time managing Vim plugins than actually writing code.

Setting up VS Code on both my Mac and Linux machines was surprisingly painless. The real game-changer was the settings sync feature. Gone are the days of manually recreating my development environment, managing dotfiles with Git and Stow, etc. - now my preferences, extensions, and keybindings follow me across devices automatically.

I like how VS Code handles Git integration. Whether I'm working with GitHub or GitLab, everything just works within the editor window. Being able to stage changes, commit, and push without context-switching is brilliant. Chuck in the integrated terminal, and I've got a really nice workflow going.

Don't get me wrong - Vim is powerful, and if you're using it daily, it's fantastic. But for occasional coders, VS Code strikes a nice balance between functionality and ease of use. Plus, let's be honest, it's probably only as bloated as my old NeoVim setup was getting!
