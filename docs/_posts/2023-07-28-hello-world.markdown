I’ve taken the opportunity of changing my domain to reboot this blog. I’m hosting it on [GitHub Pages][1] which has great support for the [Jekyll][2]  static website generator - rather than my previous solution of uploading a [Hugo][3] site to Amazon S3. Hugo was cool, but the advantage of Jekyll + GitHub Pages is the website will automatically build when I push changes to my repo. This should make it relatively simple to set up a workflow to publish posts from my iPad using Ulysses.

I followed [this tutorial][4] to get things working.
