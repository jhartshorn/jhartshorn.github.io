I manage elections for a local authority. When I'm not doing that I'm spending time with my family, hiking, gardening, gaming or reading. I'm the oldest person I know who has beaten Elden Ring.

I don’t often have thoughts that or worthy of publication, but in the event I do, here is where they’ll go.
